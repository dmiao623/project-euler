# Project Euler Solutions

## Overview

This is a list of codes and solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). The goal of this repository is twofold: to have a cloud-based backup of my codes in case my local copy ever becomes inaccessible, and to provide others with a chance to be inspired by my code solutions. 

My goal is to do at least one problem a day. So far this has been easy to maintain, but as problems become harder this will more difficult to keep up. 

## Code

My code is written in Python (for convenience) or C++ (for speed). You can find a deprecated list of my templates on [my GitHub blog](https://dustin-miao.github.io/) or [my code library](https://dustin-miao.github.io/library/). 

### Time Limit

I will generally try to abide by the "one-minute rule", in which a program to solve any given problem will take at most 60 seconds to run on a decent CPU. 

The solutions that take more than one minute are listed below:
